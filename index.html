        <p>LIm a strong believer in the notion that hard work beats talent every time. It's in this spirit that i keep working hard on every project that I do and in so doing gain as mush experience and skill as possible. Below is a list of some of the projects that I have worked on to date along with a link to git hub repositories for each one of those projects (ps. Most of then kinda suck, this id just hype ;-) )</p>
