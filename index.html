        <p><strong>My name is Victor Ireri</strong>
          <br> Im a strong believer in the notion that hard work beats talent every time. It's in this spirit that i keep working hard on every project that I do and in so doing gain as mush experience and skill as possible. Below is a list of some of
          the projects that I have worked on to date along with a link to git hub repositories for each one of those projects (ps. Most of then kinda suck, this id just hype ;-) )</p>

        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>
          I finished form four in 2013, got admited to Kenyatta University to do Food Science but that was not for me so I quit. started doing Internet marketing and some seo which laer became my fulltime job. I joined Shang Tao at the end of 2014 to learn animation but God forbid that school really sucks at being a school so I quit after a two months. I did some more internet marketing then a spent about a year and a half trading forex.
          <br>
          One common factor in my life escapades to this point had been code so I decided to learn how to code. Turns out its really fun and one thing led to another until I found myself here at Moringa School.
